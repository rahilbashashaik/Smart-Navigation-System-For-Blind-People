## Features
- Obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensor
- Real-time distance alerts
- Low cost and easy to set up
- This project uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles in front of a visually impaired person. The sensor sends distance data to a Python program, which can trigger alerts when objects are nearby. This helps the user move safely and avoid collisions.
